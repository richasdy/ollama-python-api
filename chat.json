The sky's blue, see, because o' them fancy things we call light and atmosphere.\n\nYe see, when the sun shines, it sends out all sorts o' colors - reds, oranges, yellows... But when that light passes through the Earth's atmosphere, somethin' magical happens. It scatters! And that's what makes the sky blue, me hearty!\n\nNow, I know what ye be thinkin': \"But why not green or purple?\" Well, matey, it's because o' them particles in the air. Like tiny little sea sprites, they bounce off the light and scatter it all around. The shorter, blue wavelengths get scattered more than anythin' else, so that's what we see - a big ol' blue sky!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on sunsets! That's when the light scatters even more, and we get them fancy colors, like oranges and pinks. Arrr, it's enough to make ye want to hoist the sails and set sail fer a sunset or two, savvy?\n\nSo there ye have it, matey. The sky's blue because o' science... and a wee bit o' pirate magic!"
